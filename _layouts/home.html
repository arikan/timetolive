        Time To Live project invites artists to be part of a new type of art-making process where artworks live in relation to one another.
        The artists will be asked to create new work that has agency to modify itself with inputs and outputs from other artworks in the project.
        To develop such interactions, artists will discuss and come up with protocols to organize the communication among their individual works.
