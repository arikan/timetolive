Time To Live aims to grapple with issues and conditions of today's intelligence of the artificial. The project invites artists to create new work that has agency to modify itself based on inputs and outputs from the other participating artworks. To develop such interacting artworks, artists will discuss and agree upon communication protocols among their work.
